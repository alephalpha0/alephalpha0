### Hello there, my name is Dave `alias="alephalpha0"` and these repositories are my forays into using Git as my life's CVS. 
I have tinkered and dabbled in coding since the early 2000s. My efforts had always been piecemeal; apart from hand coding the CSS and HTML of my personal domains during high school, I never succeeded in becoming "good enough" at any scripting or programming language.
My goal and plan is to change that with a clumsy, self-taught, "pincher movement" attack plan.

- [ ] Python :snake: is the main goal.
- [x] Bring back [rootofpi](https://rootofpi.me) and use it to get into HTML/CSS/Ruby. 
- [ ] Figure out what the hell a `stack` really is. 
- [ ] ~~Start~~ Continue getting used to and comfortable on the command line.
