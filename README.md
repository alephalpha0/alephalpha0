#### The Institute has released their initial collection of the Space Cowboy's data logs and made them available through the [rootofpi.me](https://rootofpi.me) archival system.

### Hello there, my name is Dave `alias="alephalpha0"` and these repositories are my forays into using Git as my life's CVS.  
 
##### I have tinkered and dabbled in coding since the early 2000s. My efforts had always been piecemeal; apart from hand coding the CSS and HTML of my personal domains during high school, I never succeeded in becoming "good enough" at any scripting or programming language.  
  
##### My goal and plan is to change that with a clumsy, self-taught, "pincher movement" attack plan.

__TODO:__  
- [ ] Python :snake: is the main goal. Learn and practice this language.  
- [x] Bring back [rootofpi](https://rootofpi.me) and use it to get into HTML/CSS/Ruby. 
- [ ] Figure out what the hell a `stack` really is. 
- [ ] ~~Start~~ Continue getting used to and comfortable on the command line. 
- [x] Become a Space Cowboy.  
- [ ] CSS / SASS. 
- [ ] HTML. 
- [ ] Ruby :gem: / Liquid. 
- [ ] Adulting.
