### Hello there, my name is Dave [alias | alephalpha0] and these repositories are my forays into using Git as my life's CVS. 
I have tinkered and dabbled in coding since the early 2000s. My efforts had always been piecemeal; apart from hand coding the CSS and HTML of my personal domains during high school, I never succeeded in becoming "good enough" at any scripting or programming language.
My goal and plan is to change that with a clumsy, self-taught, "three-pronged" attack plan.
* My current operating system environs are Manjaro Linux running the ZSH shell through Terminator on (coincidentally enough) the laptop I purchased nearly 20 years ago in high school and my new Samsung Galaxy A20 with Termux running the ZSH shell as well.
