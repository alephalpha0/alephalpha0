#  (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ [rootofpi.me](https://rootofpi.me) for the moment, a ghost town.
### Hello there, my name is Dave `alias="alephalpha0"` and these repositories are my forays into using Git as my life's CVS. 
I have tinkered and dabbled in coding since the early 2000s. My efforts had always been piecemeal; apart from hand coding the CSS and HTML of my personal domains during high school, I never succeeded in becoming "good enough" at any scripting or programming language.
My goal and plan is to change that with a clumsy, self-taught, "pincher movement" attack plan.

[ ] Python :snake: is the main goal.
[ ] Bring back rootofpi and use it to get into HTML/CSS/Ruby. 
[ ] Figure out what the hell a `stack` really is. 
[ ] ~~Start~~ Continue getting used tonand comfortable on the command line. 

> My current operating system environs are Manjaro Linux running the ZSH 
> shell through Terminator on (coincidentally enough) the laptop I 
> purchased nearly 20 years ago in high school and my new Samsung Galaxy 
> A20 with Termux running the ZSH shell as well.
> 🚀🚀🚀🚀
